\usage{
neuprint_search(
  search,
  field = "name",
  fixed = FALSE,
  exact = NULL,
  meta = TRUE,
  all_segments = FALSE,
  dataset = NULL,
  conn = NULL,
  ...
)

neuprint_ids(
  x,
  mustWork = TRUE,
  unique = TRUE,
  fixed = TRUE,
  conn = NULL,
  dataset = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{search}{Search query, by default a regular expression that must match
the whole of the neuPrint instance name field. See examples and the
\code{field}, \code{fixed} and \code{exact} for how this can be modified.}

\item{field}{the meta data field in which you want a match for your search
query. Defaults to name (or instance, as handled by
\code{neuprintr:::neuprint_name_field}). Other common options include type,
status, cellBodyFiber etc.}

\item{fixed}{if \code{FALSE} (the default), \code{search} is interpreted as a
regular expression (i.e. "Advanced input" in neuPrint Explorer). If
\code{TRUE}, the string \code{search} is interpreted as a simple character
string to be matched (the default search behavior in neuPrint explorer). In
this case partial matches are fine.}

\item{exact}{Whether the query must match the whole field. This is always
true for regular expression queries while the default (\code{NULL}) implies
false for \code{fixed} queries.}

\item{meta}{if \code{TRUE}, meta data for found bodyids is also pulled}

\item{all_segments}{if TRUE, all bodies are considered, if FALSE, only
'Neurons', i.e. bodies with a status roughly traced status.}

\item{dataset}{optional, a dataset you want to query. If \code{NULL}, the
default specified by your R environ file is used or, failing that the
current connection, is used. See \code{\link{neuprint_login}} for details.}

\item{conn}{optional, a neuprintr connection object, which also specifies the
neuPrint server. If NULL, the defaults set in your
\code{\link[=Startup]{.Rprofile}} or \code{\link[=Startup]{.Renviron}} are
used. See \code{\link{neuprint_login}} for details.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{neuprint_search}}}

\item{x}{A set of bodyids or a query}

\item{mustWork}{Whether to insist that at least one valid id is returned
(default \code{TRUE})}

\item{unique}{Whether to ensure that only unique ids are returned (default
\code{TRUE})}
}
\value{
a vector of body ids, or a data frame with their meta information

For \code{neuprint_ids}, a character vector of bodyids (of length 0
  when there are none and \code{mustWork=FALSE}).
}
\description{
\code{neuprint_search} searches for bodyids corresponding to a
  given name. By default performs regex sensitive matches against neuron
  \bold{name}s and returns a \code{data.frame}.

\code{neuprint_ids} provides for flexible search / specification
  of neuprint body ids. Use it at the start of any function that accepts body
  ids. Queries are by default partial and fixed (i.e. non-regex) against
  type. Returns a character vector of bodyids.
}
\section{Query syntax}{
 It is probably best just to look at the examples, but
  the query syntax is as follows where square brackets denote optional parts:

  \code{[!/][<field>:]<query>}

  Starting with the optional leading character. An exclamation mark denotes
  an exact, fixed search. The / denotes a regular expression (exact) search.
  When both are missing, a partial, fixed search is carried out.

  The optional field argument terminated by a colon defines a field other
  than the default one to use for the query.

  Finally the query itself is a plain text (fixed) or regular expression
  query.

\examples{
\donttest{
neuprint_search(".*DA2.*")
neuprint_search(".*DA2.*", meta=FALSE)

# Search the type field
neuprint_search("MBON.*", field = "type", meta=FALSE)
neuprint_search("MBON[0-9]+", field = "type", meta=FALSE)

# compact specification of field
neuprint_search("type:MBON[0-9]+", meta=FALSE)

# starts with MBON
neuprint_search("type:MBON.*", meta=FALSE)
}

\dontrun{
neuprint_search("MBON.*", field = "type")

# fixed=TRUE can be useful when you don't want to worry about special
# characters like brackets
neuprint_search("PEN_a(PEN1)", field="type", fixed=TRUE)
# by default fixed=TRUE returns partial matches
neuprint_search("MBON16", field = "type", fixed=TRUE)
# here the type must exactly match the query i.e. complete match
neuprint_search("MBON16", field = "type", fixed=TRUE, exact = TRUE)

neuprint_search("AVF1", field = "cellBodyFiber")
neuprint_search("cellBodyFiber:AVF1")
}
\donttest{
# exact match against whole type
neuprint_ids("!MBON01")
# partial match
neuprint_ids("MBON01")
# partial match against name field rather than type
neuprint_ids("name:MBON01")

# initial / indicates to use regex search (which must be exact)
neuprint_ids("/MBON01")
# more interesting regex search
neuprint_ids("/MBON0[1-4]")

# partial regex search against the name field (note leading/trailing .*)
neuprint_ids("/name:.*MBON0[1-4].*")
