# neuprintr 1.0

This release bumps neuprintr to v1.0. There have been a huge number of fixes and 
improvements since the last release. Furthermore we would now consider it a
mature package; we are currently using it for analysis in a number of late stage
papers and would be happy for others to do the same. You can see the [full list
of closed issues](https://github.com/natverse/neuprintr/issues?q=closed%3A2020-01-23..2020-04-04+)
